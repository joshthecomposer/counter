# COUNTER
Build a flask application that counts the number of times the root route ('/') has been viewed. This assignment is to test your understanding of session.
### Objectives:
* Create a new Flask project called counter

* Have the root route render a template that displays the number of times the client has visited this site. Refresh the page several times to ensure the counter is working.

* Add a "/destroy_session" route that clears the session and redirects to the root route. Test it.

* Add a +2 button underneath the counter and a new route that will increment the counter by 2

* Add a Reset button to reset the counter

* Add a form that allows the user to specify the increment of the counter and have the counter increment accordingly

* Adjust your code to display both how many times the user has actually visited the page, as well as the value of the counter, given the above functionality

* Decode the session cookie information
